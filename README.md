# <i>Introduction:</i>

<i>This repository consists of  Exploratory Data Analysis python jupyter notebook created by me while learning Data science as hands-on practice and also a project including both EDA & ML Algorithm. Also Tableau Public Version</i>

* <b>Data Analysis:</b>

    1. [EDA1](https://github.com/neha592/EDA/blob/master/eda1.ipynb) : To perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Dateset containing pricing of Okra in Indian Markets.
    
    2. [EDA2](https://github.com/neha592/EDA/blob/master/EDA-02.ipynb) : To perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Dateset containing movies rating by users.
    
    3. [Project](https://github.com/neha592/EDA/blob/master/Project.ipynb) : The aim is to perform Data Analytics and predict the wine quality using regression modelling. Need to perform data analysis and post out the             finding from the analysis. This Project is same as the project in ML Repositort as it has combined both (EDA+ML).
 
 * <b><u>Tools Used </u>:</b> <i> Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Scipy Tableau public Version .</i>  

I have performed Data Analysis on few datasets using Tableau Public Version whose link is here: [Tableau Profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/neha.singh3254#!/).

I have created another repository for Machine Learning projects you can view it here [ML Link](https://github.com/neha592/Machine_Learning)

Note :  The datsets used in the above files is from various datset providing sites i don't owe any of them.
